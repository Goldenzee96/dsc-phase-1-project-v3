# Aviation Accidents Analysis
## Project Overview
This project analyzes aviation data to uncover trends, identify risk factors, and reccommend saftey improvements.
Key objectives include:
- Identifying low-risk aircrafts
- Understanding trends in accidents over time.
- Mapping geographic risk patterns.
- Evaluating contributing factors to accidents.

## Contents
- **`cleaned_aviation_data.csv`**: The cleaned dataset used for analysis.
- **`Aviation_Analysis project.ipynb`**: The Jupyter Notebook containing the analysis and Visualizations.
- **`Presentation Phase 1.pdf`**: A presentation summarizing the findings and recommendations.
- **`Tableau.twb`**:(https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/zena.weru).

## Setup Instructions
1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/Goldenzee96/dsc-phase-1-project-v3.git.

## Key Insights
1. low-risk Aircraft: Highlighted aircraft with minimal accident rates and fatalities.
2. Temporal Trends: Noticed a decrease in accidents in the last decade.
3. Geographic Risks: Identified high-risk regions like United States.
4. Contributing Factors: Weather conditions and flight phases play a significant role in accident severity.

### **2. Commit and push files**
```bash
# Add all files
git add.
# Commit with a meaningful message
git commit -m " Added cleaned data, notebook, presentation, and README"
# push to the main branch
git push origin main
